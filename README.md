# URL Shortener Web Application

This URL Shortener Web Application is designed to simplify the process of converting lengthy URLs into concise and easily shareable links. It leverages the power of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and includes additional libraries such as Redux Toolkit, RTK Queries, React Router DOM, and React Redux for efficient state management and API handling.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React:** The frontend is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit simplifies state management in React applications, making it easier to manage and update application state.
- **RTK Queries:** RTK Queries is a powerful library for handling API requests and caching data on the client-side.
- **React Router DOM:** This library is used for declarative routing in the React application, allowing users to navigate between different views.
- **React Redux:** React Redux is used to connect React components with the Redux store for managing application state.

### Backend:
- **Node.js:** The backend server is powered by Node.js, providing a runtime environment for JavaScript on the server-side.
- **Express.js:** Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the development of RESTful APIs and web applications.
- **MongoDB (with Mongoose):** MongoDB is used as the database system, and Mongoose is a popular MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** JWT is employed for secure user authentication, allowing registered users to access the application securely.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** CORS is used to enable cross-origin requests, ensuring that the frontend can interact with the backend API.
